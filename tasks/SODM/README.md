SODM (Self/Other Decision-Making task)

-   *High-level task description:* Similar to the MDM task. The new
    element added is decision-making for oneself versus decision-making
    for another, described as a friend/peer who is the same age/gender
    as the subject. Whereas in MDM the trial types were either Monetary
    or Medical, in SODM we are instituting a 2x2 framework in which
    there are 4 types of trials: Medical-Self, Medical-Other,
    Monetary-Self, Monetary-Other. There are two blocks for each type of
    trial in the task.

-   *Description of User and Subject Interaction *

    -   **Keys:** \[5/%\] to begin a block; \[1/!\] for the left option
        and \[2/@\] for the right option. At the end of the task,
        message will display “Trials have ended. Please wait for the
        experimenter.” Here, press \[5/%\] to begin random evaluations
        (of which there are four). Evaluation will play out by itself
        and end with a description of the outcome (either the certain
        option or the evaluation of the lottery); press \[5/%\] to begin
        the next evaluation. Press \[5/%\] to quit task.

    -   **Trial duration**: The trial begins with the display of the
        choice, which remains displayed for the whole duration of the
        trial (until the user submits choice or 10 seconds elapses,
        whichever comes first). The user has must submit their choice
        within this 10-second time frame. If no response is recorded,
        after 10 seconds + ITI (inter-trial interval) the next trial
        will begin. For each trial:

        -   Duration of choice display: \[up to\] 10 seconds

        -   Duration of feedback duration: 0.5 seconds

        -   Duration of ITI: 2 seconds. Early choice won’t add to ITI.

    -   **Session duration**: There are eight blocks of trials. Each
        block contains 19 trials.

-   *Number of trials and values/probabilities involved *

    -   Each block contains 19 trials.

    -   Probabilities: 0.25, 0.5, 0.75

    -   Ambiguities: 0.24, 0.5, 0.74

    -   Dollar values (5): $0 (loss only), 5, 8, 12, 25

    -   Medical Scenario outcomes (5 levels): no effect, slight
        improvement, moderate improvement, major improvement, recovery
