# The life-changing magic of function handles

PsychTaskFramework pays a lot of attention to re-usability. If you just need to change one thing, you shouldn't have to copy twenty files and make the change in all twenty! This is done through **modularization** and **function handles**.

[SRP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle), [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)

## Strategy pattern
