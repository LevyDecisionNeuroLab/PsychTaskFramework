# Configuring your task

Go look at `configDefaults`. Iâ€™m not kidding; the file is thoroughly annotated. Any documentation of configuration will probably be generated by using the Matlab Publish feature and converting the output to Markdown.

Your main task script will get its settings from `configDefaults()` (or, if you write your own, `TASKNAME_configDefaults()`). It returns a `struct` with useful default values. You can change these by directly accessing the struct.

Some of the changes are essential; for instance, everything breaks unless you save the pointers that `Screen('OpenWindow')` returns to you to `.device.screenId`. Others you can do without.

I've divided the config struct into a couple of categories. You don't have to abide by them, but you will make yourself (and everyone who'll work on your code after you're long done with it) happier if you do.

Rather than explaining every value in full, you should look over `lib/defaultConfig.m`, `RA_defaultConfig.m`, and `MDM_defaultConfig.m` for the possible values. You should also look over `RA.m` and `MDM.m` to see how such `config` is loaded, and what you need to do between loading it and actually running a task block.
